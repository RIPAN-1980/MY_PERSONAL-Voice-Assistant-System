# MY_PERSONAL-Voice-Assistant-System

This is my first voice assitant system inspired by JARVIS voice assistant systant system. I would like to 
give her a name "ZENI".

ZENI is a Python-based voice assistant that can interact with the user through speech recognition, perform tasks like opening applications, searching on Google or Wikipedia, able to open different social media like facebook & youtube, playing music randomly, able to understand different language like Bangla, English & Hindi, able to search newspaper, summaries headlines & can read them aloudly,  telling jokes, and having small talk.
